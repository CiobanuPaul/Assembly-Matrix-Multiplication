# Assembly-Matrix-Multiplication
A program written in Assembly x86 AT&amp;T which creates the Adjacency Matrix for a given directed graph and creates another matrix which shows how many roads of length k (given by input) are between every two nodes. This matrix can be found by raising the adjacency matrix to the power of k.
